# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Very nice to see you here :-)  
I hope you're just as fascinated by Open Source, data and Python as I am.  
I'm always interested to find the story behind the data.  

If you want to contact me feel free either to follow this repo (you'll find more news and interesting stuff in the nearer future) or to create a ticket. [It's easy to do that there](https://github.com/squeezer44/squeezer44/issues).  

In my free time, I'm reading a lot of literature and do a lot of outdoor sports.
